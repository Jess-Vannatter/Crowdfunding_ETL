# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Overview of Aalysis
- This module focused on using the ETL ( Extract, Transform, Load ) process to build and analyze data that dealt with crowdfunding campaigns and backers. We were ablet o extract the ata from CSV/ excel files and build new CSV files from the data we analyzed. We then transformed the data by cleaning it and making it ( removing corrupt data ) and focusing on the data points we were more interested in. Specifically we created a "catagory" and "Subcategory" table. In addition to a contacts data table. 
  As for the challenege, we did utilized the ETL process onthe same data to build 2 tables related to the backers of the crowfunded campaigns that made up our data. Focusing on the backers, we created 4 new tables bt first building a SChema diagram in QuickDBD and then generating the code/ schema from this service to create the data tables in SQL. Then we used Python to analyze this data edeper. 

### Purpose 
- The purpose of this challenge/ Module was to use the ETL process in totality to obtain, transform/ analyze, and present data just like we would in a professional environment. We did this using SQL and Python.

### Results
- We were abel to succcessfully create new tables that could be investegated further for a deeper analysis by a possible analyst. If we were to present these tables to them.
